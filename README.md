# SoilMoistureDataInspection
This App allows the user to visualize soil moisture estimates from the NASA-USDA Enhanced SMAP Global Soil Moisture Data. NASA has launched the Soil Moisture Active and Passive satellite mission (SMAP) to collect key information on soil water content on a global scale. The proposed Google Earth Engine App aims to inspect New Jersey's statewide Soil Moisture temporal evolution. The app generates time series of average soil moisture estimates over a region of interest selected by the user.
